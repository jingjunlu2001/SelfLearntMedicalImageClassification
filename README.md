# SelfLearntMedicalImageClassification
Medical images are used widely by clinicians for monitoring, diagnosis, and grading of diseases. In the project, we used the deep learning and image processing methods for
unsupervised and semi-supervised image clustering, which will be applied to thoracic x-ray annotation, classification and CT based measurement for accidental findings distinguished from normal CTs. We applied these technologies to 2 datasets - BRATS17 brain tumor image dataset (https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2017/registration.html) and DeepLesion dataset (https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/DeepLesion).
